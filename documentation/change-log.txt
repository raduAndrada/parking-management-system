I wanted to remove the countdown timer from the reservationActivity in the android project but it is not efficient since i still have 
to display a countdown timer on the mobile screen therefore that logic will remain on the android app. 
The system might require some backup in case the server fails. At this point if the server stops for any reason the reservations will not
have e fineshed/completed status which might generate inconsistences between the actual parking and the virtual model the application 
implements. The physical parking must be well represented and kept updated all the time. Either trigger updated automatically on the db or
find a different approach for this issue.
